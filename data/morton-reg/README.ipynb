    "\n",
    "$\\textrm{<atlas>.csv}$\n",
    "\n",
    "+ atlas: the name of the parcellation being compared. Assume this parcellation has $N_1$ possible vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The files contain a csv, with commas separating columns and linebreaks separating rows. Assuming this is interpretted as a matrix, the structure would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        a & b \\\\\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $N$ refers to the total number of voxels in the parcellation. That is, many morton indices may not have entries. This is because the vertices indicated by a parcellation may not necessarily be the entire brain (and hence, may not include many of the morton indices are are part of the voxelwise graphs).\n",
    "\n",
    "+ $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{N}$: $a_i$ gives the morton index the $i^{th}$ row refers to.\n",
    "+ $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}^N$: $b_i$ gives the vertex that the $a_i$ morton index is within."
