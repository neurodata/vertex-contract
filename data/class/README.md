Data in class.txt is organized as follows:

each line contains the structure: "MortonID class"
where MortonID is the Morton Idx of the XYZ position of the voxel, and class is 3 for white-matter, 2 for gray-matter, and 1 for cerebrospinal-fluid. Indices that are not in the file are not mapped to a class.
